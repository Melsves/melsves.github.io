## HTML5 Flappy Bird

Written using canvasJS. Images and motion replicated as much as possible from the initial app. 

Served using Jekyll with jekyll-assets using yui-compressor

```
bundle install
jekyll build
```

## TODO

 - Abstract menu logic so that value changes and animation are not done peacemeal.
 - Add medals and other standard functionality
 - Add debug mode with common variables visible on screen
 - Upgrade to newer version of canvasJs# melsves.github.io
